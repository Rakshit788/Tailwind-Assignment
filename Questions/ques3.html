                writ large: Steve job confunded Apple in his parent's garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to
                rescue it from near bankrupty in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into
                world's most valuable cpmpany. Along the way he helped to transform several industries: personal
                computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. he
                thus belongs in pantheon of America's great inventors, along with Thomas Edison, Herny Ford, and Walt
                Disney. None of these men was a saint but long after theor personalities are forgotten, history will
                remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>
